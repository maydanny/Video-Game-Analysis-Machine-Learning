# Video Game Sales Trend Analysis

The topic that was chosen was video game sales. The reason behind this topic was because I enjoy playing games and wanted to do something related to something that I enjoy. 

The data was gathered from kaggle, link is here:

So far the machine learning algorithmns that will be used so far is Support-Vector Machine to try and predict the platform of choice based on sales and year. It was then visualized with matplotlib.
